# Adam-s-Hangman
Project 1 for General Assembly

Technologies Used:
1) Take a word inputted by player 1 and create DOM elements based on length of string.
2) Take a letter inputted by player 2 and if correct, fill in blanks. If incorrect, add body parts in succession to hangman's pole.
3) Each unique incorrect letter is inserted beneath guessing area to keep track of what letters have been guessed.
4) Each game is reset upon entering a new word.

Unsolved Problems:
1) Keeping score.
2) Making it look nice!

User Stories:
1) As a user, I should be able to play against someone else so that I can guess their word
2) As a user, I should be able to see what letters I've guessed so that I don't accidentally guess same incorrect letter twice
3) As a user, I should be able to visualize (through hangman body parts) how many incorrect guesses I have left until I lose
4) As a user, I should be able to refresh everything upon entering a new word
5) As a user, I should be able to keep score from previous games
