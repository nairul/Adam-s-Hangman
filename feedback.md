 ## Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **3: Excelling.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **2: Performing.** You've definitely hit the requirements here. Some additional functionality to add would be a timer and scoreboard.

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **2: Performing.** You have a fair bit of dead code in there. I wouldn't have that on a master branch. Consider, in the future, creating feature branches and not merging until you achieve functionality. Also, a good bit of redundancy. Formatting and naming are generally good though.

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **2: Performing.** This is a clean design, but an easy win here would be to implement flexbox techniques to make the site responsive. Additionally, look into style anchor tags as buttons. The built-in version isn't the most aesthetically pleasing.
